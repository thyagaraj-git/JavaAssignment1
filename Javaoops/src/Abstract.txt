ABSTRACT AND ITS METHODS

1.If any class has method as abstract then that class must be declared abstract?
answer: 'YES', if we didn't make class as abstract the compiler will throw error.

2.Abstract class cannot be Instantiated
answer: 'Yes',we cannot create object of abstract class,but we can inherit methods to subclass and create object of subclass.

3.When we extend the Abstract we need to provide implementation using overriding otherwise declare the subclass also abstract.
answer: the principle of abstract specifies that the subclass must provide implementation to the inherited abstract methods,If not the subclass must be declared as abstract.
public class subclass extends Abstracts
{
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		@override
		public void test()
		{
			System.out.println("implementing abstract method by overriding it");
		}
	}
}

4.Abstract class cannot be Private
answer:'yes',Because we cant implement abstract methods in subclass.

5.Abstract class cannot be Final
answer:'yes',because we cannot override the abstract class methods and can't provide implementation.

6.we can declare the class as abstract without having Abstract method
answer:Yes,we can declare class as Abstract but can't create object of it.
